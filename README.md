## How to build

System Requirements:

-   macOS 15.0+
-   Xcode 16.2+
-   Command Line Tools for Xcode
-   [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
-   [create-dmg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg)

### Steps

1.  Get source code by executing a following command in Terminal.app.

    ```shell
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pqrs-org/ShowyEdge.git
    cd ShowyEdge
    git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
    ```

2.  Find your codesign identity if you have one.<br />
    (Skip this step if you don't have your codesign identity.)

    ```shell
    security find-identity -p codesigning -v | grep 'Developer ID Application'
    ```

    The result is as follows.

    ```text
    1) 8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22 "Developer ID Application: Fumihiko Takayama (G43BCU2T37)"
    ```

    Your codesign identity is `8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22` in the above case.

3.  Set environment variable to use your codesign identity.<br />
    (Skip this step if you don't have your codesign identity.)

    ```shell
    export PQRS_ORG_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=8D660191481C98F5C56630847A6C39D95C166F22
    ```

4.  Build a package by executing a following command in Terminal.app.

    ```shell
    cd ShowyEdge
    make clean all
    ```

    Then, ShowyEdge-VERSION.dmg has been created in the current directory.
    It's a distributable package.

    Note: If you don't have codesign identity, the dmg works only on your machine.
